# OpencvSharp-Application-in-CSharp
Most of the opencv sample codes on the website are very different from the opsncvsharp used in C#. 
Therefore, the sample codes in the current folder have been modified so that the opencv code can work normally when using opsncvsharp in C#.
All code was written using OpenCvSharp4 and OpenCvSharp4.Windows, OpenCvSharp4.runtime.win, and OpenCvSharp4.Extensions libraries in VS2019.
